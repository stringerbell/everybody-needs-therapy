      <div className="text-center">
      <p>As I put on my shoes, my coat and my hat, I hollered behind me:</p>
        &nbsp;
      <p>“I’ll be right back!”</p>
        &nbsp;
      <div><p>“Where are you going?!”</p>
        <p>Small voices rang out</p></div>
        &nbsp;
      <div><p>My children appeared, doing their best to not pout.</p>
        <p>“Off to see my therapist,”</p>
        <p>I said in a hurry.</p></div>
        &nbsp;
      <div><p>“But why are you in therapy?”</p>
        <p>Their tone expressed worry.</p>
        <p>I put down my hat and knelt there beside</p></div>
        &nbsp;
      <div><p>I looked at my children, my heart full of pride</p></div>
        &nbsp;
      <div><p>“Kids, sometimes I get stuck in my head</p>
        <p>And as a result, I’m filled with dread.</p>
        <p>Going to therapy helps me get unstuck.</p>
        <p>Sharing my feelings and how I show up”</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>“Dealing with my problems that I notice build up</p>
          <p>Is a good way to be a grown-up”</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>“Is it scary? Are there monsters?”,</p>
          <p>My little girl asked</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>“Therapy is somewhere I take off my mask.”</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>“Your Mask?!”</p>
          <p>They both asked,</p>
          <p>And I started to laugh</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>“I put on my mask when I feel afraid</p>
          <p>Of changes and losses and mistakes that I’ve made”</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>“Sometimes I hide from you and your brother,</p>
          <p>My friends and my family, though we love one another,</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <p>Our masks have to come off, and we need to be seen.</p>
        <p>You know the Hulk? How he gets really green?”</p>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>They both nodded, I tried my best to explain.</p>
          <p>“It feels scary sometimes, but no monsters appear.</p>
          <p>It’s really just me facing my fear.”</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>“Being aware of these feelings is a vital task</p>
          <p>When I know what to call it, I won’t need my mask</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>If I don’t know its name, I’ll just ask my body</p>
          <p>It helps me be clear when my feelings are foggy</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>When I get angry my body feels hot</p>
          <p>I forget to breathe more often than not.</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>I feel like running and fighting and yelling</p>
          <p>All these feelings can be overwhelming!</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>Electricity walks down my arms and my back</p>
          <p>Whether excited or happy, or feeling attacked</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>The front of my throat feels tight when I’m sad,</p>
          <p>My therapist reminds me, my feelings aren’t bad!</p>
          <p>Everyone’s hurting in one way or another,</p>
          <p>And most people want to seem strong.</p>
          <p>Their pain is disguised as anger and silence</p>
          <p>And avoiding it is how they go wrong</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>Fear, Grief, Trauma, and Shame</p>
          <p>My Therapist helps me to learn their names</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>Because once you name them, and this is true</p>
          <p>They have less power over you.</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>Sometimes sad feels a lot like hungry</p>
          <p>Sometimes numb feels really safe.</p>
          <p>Lonely can feel more like afraid</p>
          <p>I even have feelings I want to erase.</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>I can't stay there though, it's not what I want.</p>
          <p>I want to be courageous and gracious and kind</p>
          <p>And all of the good things I know are inside</p>
          <p>Of me and you both, and something that helps,</p>
          <p>Is to welcome parts I don’t like in myself.</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>Whenever I’m lost, unsure or unclear,</p>
          <p>I turn to my feelings, they are always near.</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>They act like a compass and helps me to know,</p>
          <p>My strengths and weaknesses and how I should grow.”</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>“Can I go to therapy?”</p>
          <p>My sweet boy said</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>“Of course you can.”</p>
          <p>I rubbed his head</p></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p>It’s for all sorts of people, it's not just for me.</p>
